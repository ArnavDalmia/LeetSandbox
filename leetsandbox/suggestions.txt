Tier 1: Foundational Features (User Accounts & Data)
Your instinct to add OAuth and a database is spot on. This is the foundation that unlocks almost every other complex and engaging feature. Don't just add them; give them a clear purpose.
The "Why" (Your Resume Talking Point):
"I implemented user authentication using OAuth 2.0 with Google/GitHub to provide a personalized user experience. This allowed me to build features that required user-specific data, which was stored in a PostgreSQL database."
What to Build with It:
Run History:
What it is: Every time a logged-in user clicks "Run," save the problem slug, their input, the output (stdout/stderr), and a timestamp to the database.
Complexity Added: Database schema design (users, problems, runs tables), creating new API endpoints (/history), and protecting them with authentication tokens.
User Value: Users can see their past submissions for a problem, helping them track their thought process and learning.
Custom Problem Lists:
What it is: Allow users to create their own named lists (e.g., "Blind 75 Grind," "Dynamic Programming Practice") and add problems to them.
Complexity Added: More complex database relationships (many-to-many relationship between users, lists, and problems).
User Value: Empowers users to organize their learning in a way that suits them, dramatically increasing the tool's utility.
Tier 2: AI-Powered Enhancements (The "Wow" Factor)
Adding AI is a fantastic way to introduce modern complexity. Instead of just a simple API call, you can build features that showcase your ability to integrate intelligent systems.
The "Why" (Your Resume Talking Point):
"To move beyond a simple code runner, I integrated a Large Language Model (like OpenAI's GPT or Google's Gemini) to provide intelligent feedback and enhance the learning process."
What to Build with It:
AI-Powered Test Case Generation:
What it is: On a problem page, the user provides their own solution code in a text box. They click a button "Generate Edge Cases." Your backend sends their code and the problem description to an AI, asking it to generate a list of tricky inputs designed to break the user's code.
Complexity Added: Interfacing with a third-party AI service, prompt engineering (crafting the perfect instructions for the AI), and handling the asynchronous response. You can even use function calling to get structured JSON back.
User Value: This is a massive value-add. It helps users find flaws in their own logic, which is the core of learning.
AI Solution Explainer:
What it is: After running the reference solution, a button appears: "Explain this solution." When clicked, your backend sends the solution code to the AI and asks it to explain the algorithm, its time and space complexity, and any key tradeoffs.
Complexity Added: Similar to the above, but focuses on explaining existing code rather than generating new data.
User Value: Turns your tool from a simple "black box" into a true learning platform.
Tier 3: Architectural Complexity (The "Engineer" Story)
This is where you demonstrate deep technical thinking. Your idea for a Go-based service was in the original prompt, and now is the perfect time to give it a purpose.
The "Why" (Your Resume Talking Point):
"I identified a critical security and scalability risk in running untrusted user code directly within my main Python API. To solve this, I designed and implemented a separate microservice in Go, which acts as an isolated sandbox. The main API offloads code execution tasks to this service, which manages a pool of Docker containers to run code safely and concurrently. This architectural decision not only secured the platform but also improved its performance and scalability."
What to Build:
The Go Orchestrator Microservice:
What it is: This is the orchestrator/ directory from your original plan. It's a separate web server written in Go.
Its Job: It exposes a single API endpoint, like /execute. It receives a code string and inputs. Its only job is to safely run this code.
How it Works: For each request, it uses the Go Docker SDK to spin up a lightweight, temporary Docker container (e.g., based on the python:3.12-slim image), injects the code and inputs, executes it, captures the stdout and stderr, and then destroys the container.
The Final Flow:
User clicks "Run" on the frontend.
Request goes to the Python/FastAPI backend.
The FastAPI backend does not run the code. Instead, it makes a new API request to your Go Orchestrator service.
The Go service does its magic with Docker and returns the result.
The FastAPI backend relays the result back to the user.
This is a top-tier resume talking point. It shows you can think about system design, security, and using the right tool for the job (Go for concurrency, Python for the main app). It immediately elevates the project from a simple web app to a distributed system.
